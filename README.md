# RobotCollective
Robots talking to each other, chasing each other, running from each other

The repo is now a python package that you can install by going to the RobotCollective directory and typing

`pip install -e .`

This is an interactive installation, so that the package will change whenever you pull the repo. If you include any dependencies, please put them in the requirements.txt file, so that any installations just install all the dependencies at once. 

To import the modules, follow this example:

`from speech.chat_commanding import openAI_driver`
